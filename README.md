# AP-Project-Color-Switch
Color Switch Game

As part of our Advanced Programming (AP) course, we made the replica of Colour Switch Game. We used JavaFX to build the game.
In the game, the player has to collect the stars without hitting the ball to a different colour obstacle. If the player hit the obstacle of different colour, the game will end. More the stars collected, more will be the points earned by the player. Each star is worth 5 points. 
The player can resume the game by using the stars. 10 points will be deducted if the player uses the stars to resume the game.
